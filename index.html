        <p class="lead mb-4">Throughout high school, I have continually been involved in extracurricular academic activities that played an integral role in my leadership duties by allowing me to take initiative and create change within my school community. However, throughout these experiences, I have noticed personal health was overlooked. This was evident during student led conferences, many of my classmates seemed sleep deprived as they ate junk food. TI was able to influence others to keep a healthy and active lifestyle throughout the academic year by introducing them to the concepts that we practiced. I saw the impacts of the club immediately, my peers were eager to learn more. I noticed that they were applying this to their everyday lives. Personally, this was a success for “Treat Yo Self.” I was able to influence the culture of the overall school. Balancing personal wellness and our scholarly endeavors is now a normal practice. Through the creation of the “Treat Yo Self Club,” I took on an important leadership role that allowed me to help others develop self awareness and provide methods in which we can be empowered to improve overall productivity.

I am a third year Native American studies. I have come to realize that education is a critical piece for the goals I have set for myself.  As an indigenous woman, every day I see the need in my community for individuals who can help guide and support the younger generations. It is all of our responsibility to care for our communities and elevate the members who are struggling economically, physically, or spiritually. Reflecting on my participation in this sacred ceremony as a young girl, I am reminded of the colorful and varied elements of my culture that helped to shape my identity. Although I have participated in other Native American ceremonies, my experience as a pipe carrier at Sundance remains the most poignant reminder of my cultural roots. As I grow throughout my journey of life, dancing in the center of that circle reminds me that though the world around me continually shifts, I choose to remain rooted in my cultural identity.  I am determined to work hard for a higher level of education and be that advocate for the people. With a strong education I will acquire the tools to transform the world around me. Embracing culture means staying true to my Native American roots. Staying true to my identity also means committing time and energy to continue participating in Native American ceremonies. It is the ceremonies that serve as a continuous reminder of who I am and who I want to be. Through ceremonies I am reminded of the commitment I made to myself when I was nine years old to my Native American culture. I am determined to continue my education journey.  I want to keep Native American traditions alive for future generations.
